This is a collection of abstractions for puredata, created by Chris McCormick.

These require puredata 0.39-2 from http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/software.html

To install, run ./install from this directory. Then run pd as per normal.
To uninstall run ./uninstall from this directory. The old file is in .pdrc.bak

Have fun.
