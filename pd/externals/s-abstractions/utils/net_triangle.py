This script exports meshes to Raw Triangle file format across the network via UDP.
It's used to send mesh data into puredata for GEM.

This is a modified version of the Raw Triangle exporter by Anthony D'Agostino and is mostly his work.
Any mistakes are my own.

The raw triangle format is very simple; it has no verts or faces lists.
It's just a simple ascii text file with the vertices of each triangle
listed on each line. There were some very old utilities (when the PovRay
forum was in existence on CompuServe) that preformed operations on these
files.

Usage:<br>
	Select meshes to be exported and run this script from "File->Export" menu.
