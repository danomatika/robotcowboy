#X text 34 29 There are many ways of triggering and synchronizing seq.timing.slave
enabled abstractions to seq.timing.master. Here are the available four
modes (each mode is always prepended by the trigger message):;
#X obj 42 469 outlet;
#X text 156 145 That means that the abstraction can start playing on
each beat (every 24 steps).;
#X text 208 241 If you set seq.timing.slave's events/beat to 4 \, the
abstraction can start playing at any quarter beat.;
#X text 240 346 If you set seq.timing.slave's length to 16 events and
the events/beat to 4 \, the abstraction can start playing every 4 beats.
;
#X text 156 103 Next time you press play \, the abstraction will start
playing from event 0 (restarts the pattern) once it receives a new
beat.;
#X text 207 194 Next time you press play \, the abstraction will start
playing from event 0 (restarts the pattern) once it receives a new
event.;
#X text 240 301 Next time you press play \, the abstraction will start
playing from event 0 (restarts the pattern) once it receives a loop
start.;
#X text 254 400 The abstraction will start playing immediatly the next
time you press play. It will try to match seq.timing.master's current
event (does not restart the pattern).;
